    "title": "StreamGen: Connecting Populations of Streams and Shells to Their Host Galaxies",
    "abstract": "Stellar tidal debris structures are excellent probes of galaxy formation and the properties of dark matter on galactic scales. They enable constraints on tidal disruption rates, reveal the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation, and provide precise measurements of the local gravitational potential. However, these studies are complicated by the influence of host galaxy properties on satellite populations, and the limited sample size of observed and simulated galaxies. In this work, we study how the abundance and dynamics of populations of disrupting satellite galaxies change systematically as a function of host galaxy properties. We apply a theoretical model of the phase-mixing process to classify intact satellite galaxies, stellar stream-like and shell-like debris in ~1500 Milky Way-mass systems generated by a semi-analytic galaxy formation code, SatGen. We find that the counts of tidal debris are consistent across all host galaxy models, within a given host mass range, and that all models can have stream-like debris on low-energy orbits, consistent with those observed around the Milky Way. However, we find a preference for stream-like debris on lower-energy orbits in models with a thicker (lower-density) host disk or on higher-energy orbits in models with a more-massive host disk. Importantly, we observe significant halo-to-halo variance across all models. These results highlight the importance of simulating and observing large samples of Milky Way-mass galaxies and accounting for variations in host properties when using disrupting satellites in studies of near-field cosmology and assessing small-scale deviations from ΛCDM. The code designed for this work to produce realistic populations of tidal debris, StreamGen, is publicly available on GitHub."

    "title": "Surveying the Circumgalactic Medium of Simulated Dwarf Galaxies",
    "abstract": "Given their shallow potential wells, dwarf galaxies are known to undergo significant feedback-driven mass and metal loss from their disk, ejecting material into the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or even beyond the halo entirely. Thus, constraining the mass and metal retention of low-mass halos is a critical component in understanding the baryon cycle of dwarf galaxies and improving modern simulations. In this talk, I present a sample of 64 simulated dwarf galaxies from the Marvel-ous Dwarfs and Marvelous Massive Dwarfs simulations that reproduce observed CGM column densities at z∼0 in various ions. We then characterize the mass and metal retention of these halos and the physical properties of CGM gas to understand how the column densities we measure are tied to the structure and properties of the CGM. We find the majority of baryons within Rvir reside in the CGM and that ∼75% of CGM mass exists at temperatures above T > 10^4.5 K. Although this warmer CGM phase dominates the mass budget, it constitutes a similar fraction of the CGM metal budget as the cool phase. These findings demonstrate the multiphase nature of the CGM, even in the low-mass regime, and emphasizes the importance of a multi-ion approach when studying the CGM of dwarf galaxies."

    "title": "First Light from BonFIRE: A New Simulation of Early Galaxy Formation",
    "abstract": "Understanding the first billion years of galaxy formation requires simulations that capture the complex interplay of star formation, feedback, and dynamical evolution in a rapidly evolving cosmic environment. Current models struggle to reproduce key observations, such as elevated star formation efficiency (SFE) and the early emergence of disk morphology. I will introduce BonFIRE, a new large-volume, high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation designed to bridge the gap between theory and observations from JWST. I will present key results on the stellar mass–halo mass (SMHM) relation, the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) including contributions from Pop III stars, SFE, and the formation and kinematics of early disks. Finally, I will outline future prospects, such as modeling the formation and fate of globular clusters, exploring dark matter–accelerated SFE, and characterizing the environments of proto-Milky Way analogs."

    "title": "MSA-3D: dissecting galaxies at z~1 with high spatial and spectral resolution",
    "abstract": "The role of various physical processes in regulating star formation across galaxies and their impact on structural evolution is still not fully understood. Spatially resolved integral field spectroscopy (IFS) has been a key tool in characterization of galaxy properties. Resolved maps of dust attenuation and star formation are an important probe of structural evolution. MSA-3D (JWST NIRSpec/MSA “slit-stepping”) is the first survey to provide high-resolution kpc-scale IFUs across the epoch of thin disk emergence (0.5 < z < 1.5), sampling key rest-optical emission lines in 43 main sequence galaxies. We characterize radial dust attenuation profiles and measure spatially resolved dust attenuation maps for individual galaxies based on the Balmer decrement diagnostic (Hα/Hβ). Based on attenuation and Ha flux maps, we derive attenuation-corrected SFR maps for each galaxy. We find that galaxy-integrated dust attenuation increases with stellar mass -- with more massive galaxies showing higher attenuation. However, we also observe significant diversity in radial dust attenuation profiles, suggesting variations in their individual evolutionary paths. Additionally, dust-corrected SFR maps highlight the importance of accounting for dust effects to accurately measure intrinsic star formation rates."

    "title": "Spatially Resolved Galactic Winds at Cosmic Noon",
    "abstract": "Outflows play a crucial role in regulating galaxy growth by modulating the amount of gas available in a galaxy’s interstellar medium, thereby influencing star formation and, ultimately, galaxy evolution. Understanding the nature and impact of these outflows across cosmic time is essential to constraining feedback processes that shape galaxies. Strong gravitational lensing aided by sensitive Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) enables us to conduct detailed studies of the inhomogeneous outflow properties in galaxies at high-redshifts. In this talk, I will discuss results from our resolved kinematic study of outflowing gas in lensed star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon observed with Keck/KCWI.These IFS observations enable measurements of key outflow properties—including velocity structure, mass loss rates, and mass loading factors across individual galaxy halos. These measurements serve as critical benchmarks for characterizing feedback processes during a pivotal epoch in galaxy evolution. I will also briefly highlight our ongoing efforts to probe the connection between galaxies and their extended environments by studying the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) through lensed arc tomography. This novel technique leverages the continuous background provided by giant gravitational arcs to spatially map the CGM in detail, offering new insights into how galaxies interact with their surroundings during the course of their evolution."

    "abstract": "This talk will explore the exciting journey to probe several populations of black holes, spanning from the distant to the local Universe. I will focus primarily on the 'little red dots' (LRDs), a newly discovered and puzzling population of compact red sources at redshift z > 4, identified by JWST. These objects challenge our current astrophysical models in several ways. First, I will discuss the detection of overmassive black holes relative to the stellar mass of their host galaxies. Second, I will address the X-ray weakness problem, where these sources remain undetected in deep X-ray surveys. I will use advanced GRRMHD simulations to show how mildly super-Eddington accretion onto slowly spinning black holes can resolve this issue. Third, I will explore the extremely high stellar densities at the cores of these objects and their potential for triggering runaway stellar collisions; I will also describe how low-spin halos can generate such a peculiar population. Throughout the talk, I will also discuss how the LRDs represent a perfect bridge to study other populations of black holes, with a focus on the role of future observatories such as HWO and AXIS. These include the search for black hole seeds at redshifts z = 20-30 and the detection of quiescent black holes in the local Universe."

    "title": "Cosmic Rays and the CGM",
    "abstract": "Galaxies evolution is intricately tied to its circumgalactic medium (CGM) – a vast gaseous reservoir that contains the majority of all galactic baryons. Recent space-based  UV absorption studies have revealed that the CGM around low-redshift, L* galaxies is qualitatively different from the CGM of higher redshift galaxies probed with ground-based telescopes. Cosmic ray pressure in the CGM may account for this discrepancy. While we know that cosmic-ray energy makes up roughly a third of the total energy density in the interstellar medium, the amount of cosmic-ray energy in the CGM of Milky Way-mass galaxies remains unconstrained. Theoretical models predict that at this mass range, cosmic-ray pressure is not only dynamically important, but may even be the dominant pressure source in the low-redshift CGM. In this talk, I will first highlight the recent theory of how cosmic rays qualitatively change the properties of the CGM and then discuss the importance of constraining cosmic-ray transport models."

    "title": "Beyond Virial: The Curious Case of the Milky Way’s Hot Halo Gas",
    "abstract": "Recent observations have revealed the presence of a hot, super-virial gas phase in the Milky Way’s circumgalactic medium (CGM) through extragalactic absorption and blank-sky X-ray emission studies. However, the location and origin of this hot phase remain elusive—does it reside in the extended CGM, or is it instead a component of the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM)? In this talk, I will explore these questions through a two-pronged approach. First, I will present results from a systematic X-ray spectral analysis of the Galactic X-ray binary (XRB) population using Chandra's High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG), which allows us to probe the presence of hot gas within the ISM along diverse sightlines.  Our results suggest that the super-virial temperature gas is not a widespread component of the ISM but may instead be located in extraplanar regions or the extended CGM. Second, I will showcase insights from high-resolution, idealized simulations of a Milky Way–mass galaxy, designed to test physical mechanisms responsible for producing super-virial gas. Our simulations indicate that this phase originates in extraplanar regions, driven by a combination of adiabatic compression and shock heating. Together, these observational and theoretical perspectives offer a comprehensive view of the nature and origin of the Milky Way’s hot CGM component."

    "title": "Cosmic filaments: friend or foe of galaxy formation?",
    "abstract": "Cosmic filaments are the main conduits of gas accretion fueling galaxies, yet they may also inhibit star formation by cutting off cold gas supply. In this talk, I will explore the complex interplay between filaments and galaxy growth across cosmic time using observations, simulations, and models. Cosmological simulations predict that thin cold streams within filaments can efficiently feed galaxies and drive high star formation rates in the first ~2-4 Gyr (z>1). As time goes on, however, filaments become increasingly associated with suppression of galactic gaseous reservoirs and quenched star formation. While some of this is due to the extreme environments of galaxy groups and clusters, there remains a distinct influence of large-scale anisotropic structure beyond local density or stellar mass. Many observational studies enabled by large galaxy surveys such as SDSS confirm this prediction at redshift less than 0.5, but several others instead report enhanced gas fraction and star formation close to filaments. A promising approach to this tension is to separately consider the physical effects of typical high-density and those of tenuous low-density filaments. High-density filaments can exert hydrodynamic forces such as ram pressure stripping and shock-heating, severing the cold gas accretion pathways, while low-density filaments can promote cold gas accretion analogous to high-z cold streams. I will conclude by outlining prospects for mapping cosmic filaments out to z~2 by leveraging upcoming surveys such as Euclid and Roman, and for probing the gas within them via multi-wavelength spectroscopy with HST, Keck, VLT, and more."

    "abstract": "Modern simulations of the galaxy formation process now routinely reach the scales necessary to self-consistently capture the internal structure of molecular clouds while simultaneously accounting for galactic-scale gas flows. This has led to significant theoretical progress, particularly concerning star formation and stellar feedback. Galaxy formation theory has entered an era of highly precise modeling, with many predictions being robust to significant model changes. In the context of the project Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy formation’s Edge (EDGE), I will review recent advances and lessons learned from models of dwarf galaxies. I will present the latest generation of galaxy simulations, where individual stars are resolved objects, even in cosmological environments. These star-by-star simulations emphasize stellar dynamics and stellar evolution theory as key aspects of galaxy formation theory. Furthermore, with individual stars being directly accessible in our simulations we can directly derive observables. I will show how this can be applied to guide the next-generation observatories and further constrain galaxy formation theory."

    "abstract": "Constraining Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) is vital for understanding the star formation history of the Milky Way and has implications for a broad range of astrophysics including exoplanet science and galactic evolution.  Stars are excellent tools for tracing GCE because they serve as chemical 'time capsules' that generally reflect the composition of their natal birth environment.  I will present recent works that leverage stellar chemical compositions from both large surveys (e.g., GALAH, APOGEE) and small, targeted studies (the Tull Spectrograph on McDonald Observatory's Harlan J. Smith Telescope) to place critical empirical constraints on GCE in the Milky Way disk.  I will focus on the heaviest elements in the periodic table--the neutron-capture elements--and what their abundances in stars can reveal about mixing in the interstellar medium, nucleosynthesis, and binary star evolution."

    "abstract": "The satellite populations of Milky Way--mass systems have been extensively studied, significantly advancing our understanding of galaxy formation and dark matter physics. In contrast, the satellites of lower-mass dwarf galaxies remain largely unexplored, despite hierarchical structure formation predicting that dwarf galaxies should host their own satellites. In this talk, I will introduce the ELVES-Dwarf survey, designed to statistically characterize the satellite populations of isolated dwarf galaxies at 4-10 Mpc. We identify satellite candidates in integrated light using the Legacy Surveys data, then confirm the association of satellite candidates with host galaxies using surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances measured from ground-based imaging data using the Hyper Suprime-Cam, Magellan/IMACS, and Gemini/GMOS. As our first result, we surveyed 8 isolated dwarf galaxies with stellar masses ranging from sub-SMC to LMC and confirmed 6 classical satellite galaxies. We find no evidence of a ``missing satellite problem'' in the dwarf galaxy regime. However, most confirmed satellites are star-forming, contrasting with the primarily quiescent satellites observed around Milky Way--mass hosts. I will also present a serendipitous discovery of an isolated quiescent dwarf galaxy, 'Hedgehog', and discuss how such isolated quiescent dwarfs could shed light on understanding reionization quenching mechanisms. I will conclude by discussing the prospects for dwarf galaxy studies in the emerging era of LSST, Euclid, and Roman observations."
