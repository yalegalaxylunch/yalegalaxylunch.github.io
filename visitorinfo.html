    <p>
      The Astronomy Department is located on floors 4-6 of Kline Tower (KT). The 5th floor has a lounge to work in, with coffee and plenty of seating, and the talk will take place in conference room 501 at noon on Wednesday. You can enter the building through any of the three entrances listed on the map.
    </p>
            <h3>Building access</h3>
    <p>
      KT access requires a Yale ID, so you will need to let one of the organizers know when you arrive, and we will come down to get you.
    </p>
            <h3>Parking</h3>
    <p>
        Metered parking is available on Prospect St. (see map).
