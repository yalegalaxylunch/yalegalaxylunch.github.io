      <h2>About the Seminar</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Galaxy Lunch is a seminar hosted by the Yale Astronomy Department focused on discussing recent advancements in the field of galaxy formation and evolution. Each week, we bring together researchers at all stages of their careers to discuss a wide range of topics, from the earliest galaxies in the universe to the dynamics of supermassive black holes and the properties of our own Milky Way.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seminar provides an open space for presenting new ideas, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and encouraging discussions about the latest advancements in the field. The format includes a 30â€“40 minute presentation, followed by discussion and questions from attendees. Our weekly meetings are held on Wednesdays during the academic year, and all members of the Yale Astronomy Department, from faculty to undergraduates, are welcome to participate.
      </p>

        We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where attendees from all levels of expertise feel comfortable engaging with the material. Presentations are designed to be accessible to a broad audience, ensuring that anyone, regardless of their background in astrophysics, can follow along and contribute to the discussion.
