## Instructions for future Galaxy Lunch organizers

At the start of each new semester, move both the current schedule.html and semesterYEAR.json into the archive directory, and rename schedule.html in the semesterYEAR.html format. Add a new entry to the archive.html page for that semester, with the appropriate file names. 


Then create a new schedule.html and semesterYEAR.json in the main directory with the same format, and fill out the schedule for the new semester, updating the title, header, intro paragraph, and .json file in the end script in that .html file.
