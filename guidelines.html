      <h2>Guidelines for Engagement</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        This seminar is intended to be a welcoming, respectful, and intellectually engaging space for all participants. We encourage active participation from attendees of all career stages. To help foster constructive and inclusive conversations, we ask that everyone keep the following guidelines in mind:
    </p>
    <ol class="guidelines-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Engage with curiosity and respect:</strong> 
    
          Approach each presentation and discussion with openness, kindness, and respect for diverse perspectives and experiences. Every participant brings a unique perspective that enriches our collective understanding and contributes to the conversation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Critique ideas, not people:</strong> Healthy debate and critical questions are encouraged, but should always focus on the content — such as methods, interpretations, or results — rather than individuals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be mindful of varying levels of experience:</strong> Participants range from undergraduates to senior researchers. Avoid jargon when possible, and explain context when raising technical points.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Engage (and listen!) actively:</strong> If you tend to speak often, make room for others. If you usually hold back, we encourage you to share your thoughts — all contributions are valued. Let speakers finish their thoughts, and give others the benefit of the doubt. Assume good intentions and clarify rather than challenge when possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be considerate of the allotted time :</strong> If a point or ongoing conversation deserves more time than the format allows, consider continuing the discussion one-on-one after the seminar.
        </li>
